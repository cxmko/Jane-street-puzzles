    "Let's define two key probabilities to model this problem recursively:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **f(p)**: The probability that there exists at least one infinite path starting from the root with a sum of labels of at most 1.\n",
    "-   **g(p)**: The probability that there exists at least one infinite path starting from the root with a sum of labels equal to 0 (an all-0s path).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can express **f(p)** by considering the label of the root node:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The root is labeled **0** (with probability **p**): For a valid path to exist from the root, at least one of its two subtrees must contain a path with a sum of at most 1. The probability that a single subtree *does not* contain such a path is `(1 - f(p))`. Therefore, the probability that *neither* subtree contains such a path is `(1 - f(p))²`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The root is labeled **1** (with probability **1-p**): If the root is 1, we have already used our budget of a single '1'. Therefore, any valid path must continue through a subtree with an all-0s path. The probability of finding an all-0s path in a subtree is `g(p)`.\n",
